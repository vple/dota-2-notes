    Spectre flings a dagger to draw a Shadow Path, dealing damage and slowing
    the movement speed of any enemies along the trail. Units hit by the dagger
    also trail a Shadow Path. While treading the path, Spectre phases through

    Creates a spectral nemesis to attack each enemy hero after a short delay. At
    any moment during the duration, Spectre can use Reality to exchange places
    of a given haunt. Haunt illusions are uncontrollable, take extra damage, and
    deal less damage than Spectre herself. They move at 400 base movement speed
    and ignore terrain.
