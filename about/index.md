Hi! Dota 2 Notes is my small side project to create high quality, high level
Dota 2 guides and resources. I've learned a lot about Dota 2 from others, and
now I want to help you become a better Dota 2 player.

I believe there aren't very many guides that teach you how to get good at Dota
2. There are a lot of guides that show you the ropes and a lot of hero-
specific guides, which is great. But not very many guides really teach you how
to think about and understand the game.

I want to make guides and resources that teach you not only what to do, but
also how to make better decisions. Hopefully, everyone will be able to find
something useful here, regardless of how much or how little experience you
have playing Dota 2.

Currently, I don't write new articles very frequently. To help make up for it,
I put a lot of effort into making them fairly comprehensive.

## My Journey

I first started playing Dota 2 in the fall of 2012, when one of my college
friends introduced me to the game. At the time I was getting frustrated with
playing Starcraft 2, so I gave Dota 2 a shot. I was instantly hooked.

When I wasn't playing (or doing schoolwork), I was always looking for Dota 2
guides and other resources. There's one article that particularly stood out to
me---it estimated that it would take at least 6 months to become somewhat
decent at Dota 2. That was certainly disheartening, but ended up being true
for me.

Over three years later, I've played

  quite a bit of Dota 2
</a>
and worked my way up from being a complete noob. I wish I could
share my starting MMR, but when I first started the public MMR system didn't
even exist. The thing with the biggest influence on my improvement was
learning from other players. I've met several friends through Dota 2, many of
whom are way better than me. By learning from them, reflecting on my mistakes,
and practicing, I've improved to ~4.7K solo MMR.
