#Welcome!

Dota 2 Notes is an on-the-side project of mine to provide quality, high-level
resources to help others get better at Dota 2. 

I first started playing Dota 2 in the fall of 2012, when one of my college
friends introduced me to the game. At the time I was getting frustrated with
playing Starcraft 2, so I gave Dota 2 a shot. I was instantly hooked.

When I wasn't playing (or doing schoolwork), I was always looking for Dota 2
guides and other resources. There's one article that particularly stood out to
me---it estimated that it would take at least 6 months to become somewhat
decent at Dota 2. That was certainly disheartening, but ended up being true
for me.

Over three years later, I've improved a lot and am now in the upper 4K
bracket. But it took a lot of games to get here. Most of what I learned I had
to figure out on my own or from advice from my teammates. There just aren't
very many quality resources on how to play Dota 2 at a high skill level.
That's where I hope Dota 2 Notes comes into play.

In my articles, I'll aim to be fairly comprehensive; I think it's really
important to know not just what to do, but why you should do it. My preference
is to write longform articles. I know they can take some time to read, but I
think they'll be really useful, especially to players who are serious about
improving.
