Hi! I want to help you become a better Dota 2 player.

When I started playing Dota 2, I found it really hard to find really good guides. I really wanted to learn everything I could to get better, but most guides out there didn't have the depth I was hoping for.

Now that I've improved as a player, I want to give back. And I want to do that by sharing the high-level knowledge that I wish I could have found when I first got started.

Here at Dota 2 Notes, I'll be doing my best to write high-quality, high-level guides and resources. They'll include things like hero guides, mechanics and fundamentals, and various other tips and techniques. Most of all, I hope that I'll be able to share how to think and approach the game---allowing you to improve your in-game decision making.

Currently, I don't write new articles very frequently. To help make up for it,
I put a lot of effort into making them fairly comprehensive.

## My Journey

I first started playing Dota 2 in the fall of 2012, when one of my college
friends introduced me to the game. At the time I was getting frustrated with
playing Starcraft 2, so I gave Dota 2 a shot. I was instantly hooked.

When I wasn't playing (or doing schoolwork), I was always looking for Dota 2
guides and other resources. There's one article that particularly stood out to
me---it estimated that it would take at least 6 months to become somewhat
decent at Dota 2. That was certainly disheartening, but ended up being true
for me.

Over three years later, I've played

  quite a bit of Dota 2</a>
and worked my way up from being a complete noob. I wish I could
share my starting MMR, but when I first started the public MMR system didn't
even exist. The thing with the biggest influence on my improvement was
learning from other players. I've met several friends through Dota 2, many of
whom are way better than me. By learning from them, reflecting on my mistakes,
and practicing, I've improved to ~4.7K solo MMR.
