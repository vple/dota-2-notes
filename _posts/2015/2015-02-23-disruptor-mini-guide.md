  Tips and techniques for getting the most out of Disruptor's spells.
---

Let’s take a look at Disruptor. This support hero struggles without a handful of levels, but is capable of bringing quite a bit to the team. In this mini-guide I’ll be focused primarily on effective usage of Disruptor’s spells.

If you’re not already familiar with Disruptor’s spells, you can look at them <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Disruptor" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Basic Spell Usage

We’ll start with the straightforward use of Disruptor’s spells. In the next sections, we’ll cover combos and more advanced usages.

The skill build I would strongly recommend is to have one point in each skill by level 3. Then, take Glimpse and your ultimate for levels 4--7. After that is up to you.

## Thunder Strike

This spell is a pretty powerful nuke; its 160 AoE damage (before reduction) at level 1 makes it quite powerful as a harassment tool. It’s a bit odd as far as nukes go, as it deals its damage in four instances over a six second period.

The second main part of this spell is that it provides vision of its target during the duration of the spell. This means that if you want to ensure that you have vision of a specific opponent, cast Thunder Strike on them! This is especially important for ganks as well as for Thunder Strike + Glimpse combos.

## Glimpse

Glimpse is Disruptor’s most powerful (non-ultimate) spell. Used properly, this spell alone can devastate the opposing team. However, it’s a bit tricky to get the hang of; you’ll need to start thinking in terms of where your target was four seconds ago. Alternatively, you can think of Glimpse as a way to bring your target back to where they are now after you cast Glimpse on them four seconds into the future.

We’ll go into Glimpse in much greater detail later on, but three of the most common ways to use Glimpse are:

* Bringing back a retreating enemy. It’s quite hard to escape from a Disruptor as long as Disruptor has vision of you. Ideally this is used to bring a target back into your team, where you can all kill him.
* Sending away an approaching or initiating enemy. Used this way, Glimpse can be a pseudo escape tool or a means of isolating two approaching teammates from one another.
* Sending someone back to where they teleported from. Using Glimpse on someone within 4 seconds after their TP will send them back to wherever they teleported from. This can be useful for wasting your opponent’s time and money, as well as for improving your numbers advantage in an ensuing fight.

Disruptor’s skill build is fairly flexible, but Glimpse should always be maxed first; low levels of Glimpse aren’t that great and the spell improves dramatically with each level. In particular, levelling this skill gives additional cast range and reduced cooldown. At level four, Glimpse’s 18 second cooldown allows it to be used multiple times in a fight. In addition, its 1800 cast range allows you to pull back opponents even after they’ve blinked away!

## Kinetic Field

A relatively simple spell, Kinetic Field forms a barrier that your opponents cannot cross (in or out). However, Kinetic Field doesn’t stop your opponents from using spells or items to pass through the field (be aware that you cannot escape the field with force staff).

The most straightforward use of Kinetic Field is to trap someone inside of it. Without setup, this can sometimes be tricky as there is a small delay before the field actually stops opponents from passing through.

You can also use Kinetic Field to help escaping allies. Just use it to block the retreat paths that your allies are taking.

## Static Storm

Static Storm is yet another versatile spell in Disruptor’s toolkit. Since it provides an AoE silence with a pretty short cooldown, it can be used to great effect in both team fights and ganks.

Usage of Static Storm is easy to understand---drop it on the target(s) you want to silence. The longer you can keep them in the field, the more damage they’ll take (and of course, the longer they’ll be silenced). There’s a natural synergy between Static Storm and Kinetic Field, which are about the same radius; if you can catch someone in a Kinetic Field and a Static Storm, they’ll be unable to escape without magic immunity or an ally’s help.

It’s very easy to cast Static Storm, but be judicious with your usage! Static Storm can single-handedly win a fight, but a whiffed one can make your fight much harder than it could have been. Eventually, you’ll find yourself being able to make snap calls as to when and where you should or shouldn’t drop a Static Storm.

# Advanced Spell Usage and Combos

Alright, let’s get into the fun stuff. Disruptor’s spells are even more powerful than they might seem on the surface; proper usage nearly guarantees pickoffs and kills in team fights.

## Advanced Mechanics

We’ll first go over the more advanced mechanics of each spell.

* All of Disruptor’s spells are negated by spell immunity.
* Thunder Strike’s damage is done in four strikes over a six second period. To be more precise, the first strike is done at spell cast, and each of the next three strikes are done two seconds after the previous cast. This is important because it measure where your opponent will be when you cast Glimpse on them! If you cast Glimpse exactly when the third strike hits, your opponent will be returned to where they were when you initially casted the spell. If you Glimpse sometimes between the third and fourth strikes, they’ll end up somewhere between where they were for the first and second strikes. And remember---Thunder Strike provides vision of the target during its entire duration, making it easier for you to cast Glimpse on them.
* The Glimpse projectile provides vision. There’s also a blue indicator where the target will return to.
* Glimpse cancels channeling spells/items. This is quite useful for cancelling TPs, as well as heroes who cast channeling spells from hard-to-reach places (such as Witch Doctor and Bane). When cancelling TPs, waiting a little bit before casting Glimpse will ensure that your target won’t travel as far from their TP location.
* Glimpse persists through death; if your opponent dies and buys back during Glimpse, they will be brought back to where they were before dying.
* When a hero dies, they stay at their death position until they respawn. This means that you can Glimpse someone shortly after they respawn and they will be brought back to wherever they died.
* Glimpse destroys illusions.
* Like Disruptor’s other spells, Kinetic Field also provides vision!
* Static Storm’s Aghanim’s upgrade increases its duration, damage, and allows it to silence items. In particular, if you catch and keep someone in your upgraded Static Storm, they can’t cast BKB. However, they are free to use their items if they get their BKB off before your Static Storm.

## Combos

Disruptor’s spells have incredible synergy. Note that these combos can be chained into one another.

* First off, the combo that has been mentioned a few times already: Thunder Strike &#8594; Glimpse. Casting Thunder Strike gives you vision of your target for six seconds, allowing you to easily Glimpse your target within that duration. As mentioned, Thunder Strike can also help you line up your Glimpse timing if you aren’t already keeping track of that.
* Glimpse &#8594; Kinetic Field. This is Disruptor’s bread and butter combo. When you Glimpse someone, you can see (or estimate) where they’ll end up. If you cast Kinetic Field around that spot shortly before they arrive, they won’t be able to escape without some kind of mobility item or spell.
* Kinetic Field + Static Storm. This combo is a bit harder to execute (because Kinetic Field has a formation time) but is very powerful when done properly. Most heroes caught in this combo will have a tough time doing anything unless they have a BKB.
* Glimpse &#8594; Static Storm. This combo (along with possible a Kinetic Field) is the variant on Glimpse &#8594; Kinetic Field for heroes with an escape spell, such as Storm Spirit, Anti-Mage, Queen of Pain, and Riki. It’s important to get the Static Storm down before the Glimpse finishes, otherwise your target might escape!

## Additional Usage Tips

* In case I haven’t mentioned it enough, Glimpse is a very strong tool for bringing back retreating opponents. There are a variety of reasons your opponent might be running away from you, but there are two fairly common ones.
  1. Your opponent is running from a gank or team fight. We’ve covered this one a bit already.
  2. The opposing team just tried to push a tower and is now backing off, be it to retreat or to wait for the next creep wave or whatever. This is an opportune time to bring someone back and pick them off. Make sure the enemy team is a bit out of range before glimpsing back. Additionally, pick the most high-priority target that your team can pick off easily.

* Against a hero like Storm Spirit, Queen of Pain, or Anti-Mage, do not hesitate to drop your Static Storm on them if your team is nearby to kill them. Sometimes the right move in a game is to reserve your ultimate exclusively for these heroes.

* Don’t panic when someone initiates on your team! Many players instictively Glimpse them away---which is sometimes the opposite of what you want to do. If you know your team can kill them, instead make sure that the remainder of the opposing team can’t approach. You can do this with Glimpse, Kinetic Field, or a zoning Static Storm. On top of this, if the initiator is a Storm Spirit, drop a Static Storm on him so you can lock him down long enough for your team to punish him.

* On a related note, don’t always Glimpse someone who is teleporting into a tower! If it’s very early in the game, it’s great to do this as it wastes their time and money. However, if your teammates are nearby (because you are pushing) then you can kill the target teleporting in instead! Just drop a Kinetic Field as their TP finishes to hold them in. If there are multiple TPs, you can use your Glimpse on the second TP (or on the most dangerous hero teleporting in). Remember that you can determine who is teleporting in by the TP color.
<br>
A word of caution here---be aware if there are any opponents already in the area (particularly initiators). If there are, you probably want to Glimpse that first TP away.

* Casting Glimpse on an enemy Batrider will break their Flaming Lasso.

* Disruptor has great synergy with a lot of AoE teamfight heroes. Disruptor can be set up by or set up for spells such as Black Hole, Chronosphere, Reverse Polarity, Chain Frost, and Song of the Siren.
