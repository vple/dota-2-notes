  Techniques to avoid giving away important spells when playing against Rubick.

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Rubick" name="Spell Steal" heading="h2" %}

Rubick's Spell Steal can easily make or break a team fight. If Rubick manages to steal a good spell, such as Ravage, Fissure, or Black Hole, he can single-handedly win a fight for his team. In this article, we'll take a look at three techniques to playing around Rubick's Spell Steal.

# Protect Your Spells

The first technique is to protect your important spells by giving away a lesser spell. It's easy to do this---just use a different spell immediately after casting the spell you want to protect. Since Rubick can only steal the last spell that you cast, this allows you to "pick" which spell to give to Rubick.

Although this technique is very effective, it isn't a foolproof method for a few reasons:

- Some heroes, like Viper, can't cast other spells. You have no choice but to give away your one spell.
- It's very hard to avoid giving Rubick a channelled spell, like Black Hole.
- Spells have ending cast animations, allowing good Rubicks to steal spells anyway.

Still, it's good to get in the habit of being aware of which spells you don't want to give away if you can avoid it. The tricky part is having the presence of mind to make this a habit.

## Examples

### Ravage

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Tidehunter" name="Ravage" heading="h2" %}

Tidehunter's Ravage stuns in a massive range. Although it's impossible to stop good Rubicks from stealing it, it should at least be difficult. After using Ravage, use Anchor Smash right away---even if you can't hit anyone with it.

It's possible to use Gush as well, but Gush is a targeted spell (making it slightly more involved to use). Furthermore, Anchor Smash is a really bad spell for Rubick because it requires positioning yourself very close to enemies, which Rubick doesn't want to do.

As an extra note, get in the habit of using Anchor Smash every time you're in your fountain. If Ravage was the last spell you cast before you died, Rubick can steal it from you when you respawn!

### Storm Hammer

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Sven" name="Storm Hammer" heading="h2" %}

Sven's Storm Hammer is a ranged, targeted, AoE stun. As such, it's a great spell for Rubick. In fights, you'll typically be using Storm Hammer, War Cry, and God's Strength, in some order. So, just make sure to use War Cry or God's Strength immediately after using Storm Hammer.

Although this tends to happen naturally (Storm Hammer into War Cry so your team can catch your target), this order can easily change when you have a blink dagger. There's a tendency to use War Cry to catch up to a target, ult beforehand, then blink and stun. This sequence gives away Storm Hammer. Since we typically need to use War Cry for the move speed, this means that we'll need to blink, stun, and then use God's Strength.

### Death Ward

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Witch Doctor" name="Death Ward" heading="h2" %}

Death Ward is a bit tricky because it's a channelled spell. Casting another spell directly after casting Death Ward means that you'd have to cancel your own ultimate, which you probably don't want to do. So, is it actually possible to protect Death Ward?

As you might guess, the answer is yes. It turns out that Witch Doctor's Voodoo Restoration is a toggled ability that doesn't interrupt channelling! So, all we have to do is use Death Ward and then immediately turn on Voodoo Restoration. (If it's already on, you can toggle it off and then on again.)

### Doom

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Doom" name="Doom" heading="h2" %}

Our final example is Doom's Doom. One of the best single target disables, Doom essentially takes a hero completely out of a fight. Like Ravage, it's impossible to fully protect this spell. However, you should still make it hard for Rubick to get his hands on it.

The process for protecting Doom is to use Scorched Earth immediately after Doom. **This means you have to hold onto your Scorched Earth until you Doom.**

If you happen to already have Scorched Earth on cooldown, you could try to use Devour. However, this is often impractical since you'll be fighting (and you'd need a creep right next to you). As such, try to save Scorched Earth so you can prevent Rubick from stealing Doom.

# Targeting Rubick

The second technique to not giving Rubick an important spell is to make sure you catch him in your spell (if it's a disable) or your team kills him quickly. If you can manage to do this, you'll absolutely protect your spell. However, this is dependent on how good the enemy Rubick is---a good player will stay out of vision and be hard to catch.

The important thing to remember about this technique is that it requires either patience and awareness on your part, or a mistake on Rubick's part (or some combination of the two). **You will have to wait for an opportunity to catch Rubick.**

The difficulty with this is waiting to catch Rubick while not giving up on a good opportunity to use your spell but not catch Rubick in it. Of course, this is a decision you'll have to make within your game.

## Examples

### Storm Hammer

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Sven" name="Storm Hammer" heading="h2" %}

We'll first revisit one of our previous examples---Storm Hammer. If you can catch Rubick in Storm Hammer's AoE, it shouldn't matter whether or not you can protect the spell since your team should be able to kill Rubick immediately.

### Reverse Polarity

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Magnus" name="Reverse Polarity" heading="h2" %}

Magnus's Reverse Polarity is actually a very easy spell for Rubick to steal since the spell's ending lag is relatively long. By catching Rubick in Reverse Polarity, we pretty much guarantee his death. Even if he doesn't die, it buys enough time for Magnus's follow up Skewer or Shockwave, allowing us to protect RP.

### Black Hole

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Enigma" name="Black Hole" heading="h2" %}

Without a doubt, Enigma's Black Hole is one of the biggest and easiest spells that Rubick can steal. Unlike Witch Doctor's Voodoo Restoration, Enigma has no way of stopping Rubick from stealing Black Hole---other than catching him in it.

# Watch Cooldowns

The last technique to avoid giving Rubick an important spell is to wait until Rubick steals something else first. This works best when Rubick doesn't have an Aghanim's scepter; after he obtains one, the Spell Steal cooldown is very short.

At level 3, Spell Steal has a 16 second cooldown. If Rubick steals a spell, this means that he's unable to steal any spell for a reasonable amount of time. During this window, you have the ability to use your valuable spells without worrying about Rubick stealing them.

When this opportunity occurs, it's foolproof. However, a good Rubick will save his Spell Steal until he's able to get something that he wants. If you have a really big spell, like Black Hole, this could result in a sort of stalemate. You save your big spell to play around Spell Steal, whereas Rubick saves Spell Steal for your big spell. These situations can end up being tricky, and you'll have to decide if it's more important to use your spell or to prevent Rubick from stealing it.
