  Fundamentals of playing Slark: farming, fighting, and itemization.
---

Notorious for being a slippery hero, Slark is an agility carry that's easily capable of snowballing and dominating a game. A good early game sets Slark up for an explosive mid game where he is able to find kills all around the map. However, even though Slark is good at ganking, he actually has trouble in organized team fights.

In this primer, we'll go over the techniques needed in order to be impactful as Slark. We'll cover not just typical builds, but also how you should prioritize your items and time.

Let's get started!

# Overview

## Strengths

Slark is perhaps best known for his ganking ability. Between Pounce and Dark Pact, Slark is able to dish out 500 magical damage, pin down a target, and beat on them while briefly being immune to most disables and debuffs. On top of this, Slark quickly heals up afterwards thanks to Shadow Dance, allowing him to be ready to go for another gank.

Even though his ganks are usually quick and effective, Slark also excels in prolonged, scrappy team fights. Essence Shift allows Slark to become stronger as the fight goes on, signficantly increasing his attack speed and damage.

Played properly, Slark is also quite hard to kill. All three of his active skills give him tools to escape from danger---he can dispel debuffs, disjoint projectiles, and become invisible and untargetable.

In addition to his fighting ability, Slark is also able to farm reasonably quickly with the aid of Dark Pact.

## Weaknesses

Although Slark is good at fighting, he is actually quite easy to kill if a coordinated opponent manages to disable him. Because of this, Slark can actually have difficulties in team fights if he's not careful. Even though he's a slippery hero, Slark is actually fairly squishy without items.

Slark also has mana problems. Although his spells have low mana costs, Slark doesn't return to the fountain very often. Good mana management is a must in order to stay efficient and effective as Slark.

Surprisingly, Slark actually also has a mobility problem. Shadow Dance does give him a lot of mobility, but only when he isn't visible to the opposing team. Slark loses this mobility in fights, making it harder for him to stay on a target.

Finally, Slark can have difficulties during the laning phase. This typically won't be a problem with some support, but Slark doesn't really have good tools to contest an aggressive lane.

## Strategy

Most carries excel at farming, ganking, or team fighting, but not all three. Slark is good at farming and ganking, so our game plan is to utilize those strengths to get ahead in the early and mid game. Then, we'll use our advantage to get items that allow Slark to effectively fight in 5v5 team fights.

# Skills

Before moving on, we first need to go over Slark's skills. Understanding the basic effects of Slark's skills are straightforward, but it's useful to know all of the nuances.

## Dark Pact

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Slark" name="Dark Pact" heading="h2" %}

The straightforward usage of this spell is to deal damage to his opponents. Slark's bread and butter combo is to land a Pounce and to use Dark Pact. This locks his target in place, dishes out damage, and ensures that Slark can't be disabled until Dark Pact ends. In the midgame, a Dark Pact + Pounce combo is usually enough to bring down squishier heroes, especially if you have backup.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/dark-pact-pounce-combo.jpg"
  caption="The Dark Pact and Pounce combo." %}

Dark Pact's other main use is for farming. It's a 40 mana AoE nuke with a cooldown of 6 seconds. You can and should **use it liberally to farm lane creeps and jungle creeps.** Be more careful with Dark Pact usage if you expect your opponent is looking to initiate on you---if they see Dark Pact on cooldown they'll go in.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/dark-pact-farming.jpg"
  caption="Nuking down creeps with Dark Pact." %}

However, the reason that Dark Pact is such a powerful spell is that it applies a strong dispel to Slark. This means that **it's almost impossible to keep a disable or debuff on Slark during Dark Pact**. It even allows Slark to get out of ultimates, such as Bane's Fiend's Grip and Batrider's Flaming Lasso. If you're trying to dispel a disable, remember that you have to cast Dark Pact before the disable hits you.

Notably, **Dark Pact dispels dust.** This can be useful if you opt for a shadow blade.

Important spells that Dark Pact does not dispel include:

* Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast
* Axe's Berserker's Call
* Bloodseeker's Rupture
* **Doom's Doom**
* Earth Spirit's Enchant Remnant
* Huskar's Burning Spear
* Invoker's Deafening Blast
* **Legion Commander's Duel**
* Outworld Devourer's Astral Imprisonment
* Viper's Viper Strike
* **Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse**

We'll cover Dark Pact in more detail when we look at fighting, but you'll often be spamming Dark Pact throughout a fight. Failing to remove a disable can easily mean death for Slark. It's much easier to time Dark Pact if your opponents only have non-instant disables.

If you're able to predict when your opponent will try to disable you (for example, because you can react to their projectile stun) you can save your Dark Pact for that moment. However, it's usually better to just use Dark Pact whenever you can, since failing to remove a disable can easily result in your death.

## Pounce

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Slark" name="Pounce" heading="h2" %}

Pounce travels up to 700 units, stopping early if there is an enemy hero within a 95 unit radius of Slark. We'll break Pounce up into two parts---the leap, when Slark travels forwards, and the latch, where Slark leashes an enemy hero.

### Leap Mechanics

**Leap disjoints projectiles.** You can dodge Sven's Storm Hammer, Vengeful Spirit's Magic Missile, etc.

If Slark doesn't latch onto a hero, Pounce functions similarly to a force staff. In addition to using it offensively, you can use it defensively to help you escape. You can also leap up and down terrain.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/pounce-cliff.jpg"
  caption="Using Pounce to leap down a cliff." %}

When using Pounce to escape, make sure that there are no heroes in front of you. Otherwise the Pounce will latch and your escape will be cut short.

Trees are destroyed around Slark at the end of his Leap, regardless of whether or not it latches.

### Latch Mechanics

**Latched heroes are not disabled.** Landing Pounce applies a debuff, but doesn't disable in any way. In particular, Pounce will not interrupt channeling spells or TPs. It's more of a pseudo-disable.

Pounce latches onto invisible units. It does not latch on spell immune units. It also doesn't latch onto illusions, so it's possible to use Pounce to distinguish between illusions and real heroes.

Mirana's Leap and Magnus's Skewer cannot break the leash. Force staff also can't break the leash. Other positioning spells are able to escape from the leash.

## Essence Shift

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Slark" name="Essence Shift" heading="h2" %}

The simplest of Slark's four skills, each Essence Shift stack temporarily steals one of each attribute from Slark's target and gives Slark three points of agility. As a result, Slark gets stronger and stronger as fights draw on.

Essence Shift steals its stats before Slark's attack damage goes through. This means that **Essence Shift gives Slark up to 22 addititional damage per attack** when attacking enemy heroes. That's because Slark gains 3 damage from his +3 agility, while his target loses 19 maximum HP due to their -1 strength.

The Essence Shift buff and debuff are not linked and can't be dispelled. Slark loses all of his stacks when he dies, but this doesn't cause his targets to regain their stats. Likewise, if Slark's target dies, they regain their lost stats but Slark doesn't lose his bonus agility until it expires or he dies. **You lose your Essence Shift stacks if you die with an aegis.**

## Shadow Dance

{% include dota/skill.html hero="Slark" name="Shadow Dance" heading="h2" %}

In case it isn't clear from the description, note that Shadow Dance consists of two parts.

### Passive

The first part is a passive---whenever Slark isn't visible to the enemy team, he receives a buff that gives him movement speed and health regeneration. This has a few uses.

When it comes to farming, the Shadow Dance passive allows you to use Dark Pact liberally. You can farm without worrying too much about your HP, since you can just hide and regen up as needed. Do note that getting hit by neutral creeps disables Shadow Dance.

The passive also allows Slark to heal up during fights. Slark just needs to run out of vision briefly, heal up, then return to the fight. This is an important part of Slark's fighting style, which we'll look at later.

Because Slark's passive is triggered by not being in enemy vision, you can tell when your opponent has vision of you. **Use this to let your team know where enemy wards are.** When figuring out where the ward is, take a bit of time to try to narrow down exactly where the ward is. Supports don't like wasting sentries, so they'll appreciate it.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/find-wards.jpg"
  caption="Let your supports know where the enemy wards are." %}

### Active

The second part is an active---Slark hides himself completely in a cloud of shadows.

Slark's active renders him invisible, but unlike other forms of invisibility Slark cannot be revealed at all. This means that the active part of Shadow Dance will always trigger the passive part, so Slark will regen HP during his ultimate.

Although Slark is invisible during the active part of his ult, there's are clouds of shadows surrounding him that are visible to the opposing team. Slark can still be hit by AoE damage, but can't be targeted by attacks or spells from the enemy team.

The main use of Slark's ultimate is either to help you escape or to ensure that you can't be targeted when you commit to a fight.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/slark-shadow-dance.jpg"
  caption="Your opponent can't hit you with attacks or targeted spells during Shadow Dance." %}

# Skill Build

Slark's skill build is extremely static. You'll want to start with Pounce at level 1. At level 2, get a value point in Essence Shift. Then max Dark Pact, Pounce, and Essence Shift in that order.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/slark-skill-build.jpg"
  caption="Standard Slark skill build." %}

We want Pounce at level 1 since it's Slark's best spell for setting up kills.

A value point in Essence Shift at level 2 makes your right clicks more effective against enemy heroes, as it allows you to do an extra 22 damage. This means that you'll often trade favorably when it comes to lane harass.

The reason Dark Pact should be maxed before Pounce is that Dark Pact allows Slark to farm jungle camps and to nuke down creep waves. Dark Pact allows you to accelerate your farm.

There are two minor deviations from this skill build that are used very rarely. First, you might take a second point in Pounce if you have a very active lane that will often go for skirmishes. Second, you might take Essence Shift at level 1 if you find yourself in a 1v1 lane, as it gives you an edge when trading harass.

# Fighting

Although Slark's spell usage in team fights is fairly straightforward, his fighting style is deceptively complex. This is because it involves balancing a number of conflicting factors.

On one hand, Slark wants to get into the fight. He'll be initiating a fair amount, wants to rack up Essence Shift stacks, and is responsible for dishing out a lot of the team's damage.

On the other hand, Slark is an extremely high priority target. Good opponents can and will take you out as soon as they can. It's really important to not overextend---especially when you don't have any spells or items that help keep you alive. Slark is a slippery hero, but isn't that hard to kill if he gets disabled.

## Spell Awareness

One of the most important aspects of team fighting with Slark is spell awareness. Spell awareness refers to which spells have been used, and therefore which spells are still available. This applies both for Slark's spells and his opponent's spells. This is so important that it is largely what leads to the different fighting styles you'll use during a fight.

### Your Spells

When it comes to Slark's spells, the most important thing is whether or not you have access to Dark Pact. **If Dark Pact is on cooldown, you must play accordingly.** Good opponents will see when you Dark Pact and save their disables until your Dark Pact ends.

When you use Dark Pact, you need to have some idea of what you'll do when the spell completes. There are two main options.

First, you can back off. This gives you time to hide, if necessary, to heal up. It also gives you time for Pounce and Dark Pact to come off cooldown. You can then go back into the fight and repeat.

Second, you can commit to the fight. Again, **Slark is vulnerable without Dark Pact.** You'll need to make the judgment call as to whether or not it's necessary, but this usually means that you'll need to use Shadow Dance (or BKB) to continue fighting. As long as your opponents can't lock you down, you should be able to get stuff done in a fight.

### Enemy Spells

The other part of spell awareness is keeping track of your opponent's spells. The more spells that your opponent has yet to use, the more careful you need to be. On the flip side, if your opponents have used most of their spells, it's often safer to commit to a fight, even when Dark Pact is on cooldown.

There are two main ways to deal with opposing spells.

**First, wait for the initial round of spells to be used.** A lot of spells are often used in the first few seconds of a team fight, so there will be a lot less for you to worry about if you're not caught in that initial barrage. Essentially, this approach means entering the fight after it starts.

**Second, approach from different angles.** If you can enter a fight from an unexpected angle, it's harder for your opponents to coordinate against you and you might be able to find an easy kill.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/slark-backlines.jpg"
  caption="Finding a kill on the back lines." %}

If you're playing against Doom, Legion Commander, or Winter Wyvern, you almost always have to wait for them to use their ultimates if they're nearby and you don't have an aegis.

This changes when you're ahead. If you're strong enough, you can play more aggressively without worrying about being punished. The factors above still matter and you will be punished if you overextend, but Slark is much harder to deal with when he's snowballing.

## Posturing

The start of a team fight usually involves posturing from both teams. Each team is looking for opportunities to harass and get in some damage without committing to a fight. If an opportunity presents itself (such as a hero being out of position) then someone can jump in and actually initiate the fight.

Slark wants to look for out of position heroes that he can initiate on, especially squishy heroes. It's important that one or more of the following are true:

* You can quickly burst down and kill your target.
* Your team can quickly back you up to kill your target.
* The opposing team can't respond quickly to your initiation.

If none of these are true, you need to back off for a few seconds after hitting your target. View this more as harassment---you don't want to commit to a fight unless it's safe or you can get a favorable initiation. Backing off lets your cooldowns reset; then you can go back in.

Note that not committing to a fight also makes it easier to back off and heal up if you need to.

## Committing

As mentioned, you usually don't want to commit unless you're in a favorable position. When you do want to commit, you often want to avoid giving your opponent a chance to disable you.

Typically, you commit when you go in with Pounce and Dark Pact without trying to back out towards the end of your Dark Pact. **To avoid getting locked down, you'll need to use Shadow Dance or a BKB charge as Dark Pact ends.** This can then be followed up with a second Dark Pact.

Of course, you don't have to use BKB or Shadow Dance if you have a good read on the situation.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/shadow-dance-usage.jpg"
  caption="Use Shadow Dance when you commit to a fight with Dark Pact on cooldown." %}

Fighting against heroes like Doom or Legion Commander require you to change your playstyle. You'll probably need to use Shadow Dance immediately when you go in, as you'll immediately be targeted and disabled---Dark Pact can't save you here.

## Clean Up

It's entirely possible that the team fight won't be over by the time you use up all of your defensive skills. If your team has clearly own the fight and your opponent is out of options, feel free to chase down any remaining survivors.

However, if you're low, do your best to get out of the fight. Once you escape, you can hide and heal up on HP. Once you feel like you have enough HP, you can return to the fight. You don't have to regen to 100% HP; just enough to feel comfortable fighting.

Drawn out, scrappy fights are Slark's forte since his ability to rapidly regenerate and steal stats helps swing these fights in your favor. Even though you won't have Shadow Dance when you return to the fight, your opponents won't have their high cooldown spells either.

# Farming

Slark is actually decent at farming, even without items, thanks to Dark Pact.

Once you have level 6, you can use Dark Pact liberally to farm. Use Dark Pact to nuke down lane creeps and jungle creeps, then hide if necessary to recover your HP.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/slark-farm-jungle.jpg"
  caption="Farming jungle camps." %}

If you're farming where your opponents have vision of you, be careful. Enemy heroes can easily jump you with blink daggers when your Dark Pact is on cooldown, so remember to move out of vision until Dark Pact comes back up.

**Remember that Slark still needs to farm, even though he excels at fighting.**

## Finding Balance

How do you balance farming and fighting? This is more of a general carry question rather than Slark-specific question, but it's definitely easier to maintain this balance as Slark.

For me, the main catalysts to my team fight participation are my items and opportunity.

Before getting drums, I rarely want to fight unless the fight is forced upon me---such as someone (from either team) ganking my lane. If I have at least level 6, I might TP in to bigger fights if they occur near my tower and I'll still be able to get involved in the fight, such as when my opponents dive a tower. However, it's usually much more important for me to focus on my farm and to get all of my early game items.

Note that this means I'll rotate to the jungle if necessary. I'd rather farm jungle creeps than mill about aimlessly near my tower. If there's a solo hero nearby I'll bully them a bit if I can, but it's still more important to get farm.

After getting drums, I'm much more willing to participate in fights. Again, this is done opportunistically, but I'll be more proactive about joining. If I see a big or important fight is going to break out, I'll at least consider heading over in advance. My preference, however, is to continue farming for my mobility item.

Once I have a shadow blade or blink dagger, it's time to be more active. However, **you do not have to commit to looking for a fight.** Rather, I'll position myself to farm near where a fight is likely to break out so that I can initiate or react as necessary. I might also encourage my team to start forcing a fight, such as by pushing a tower.

Beyond this point, you'll usually want to continue farming while staying relatively close to where your team will fight. Even when you're not that close, you can run pretty quickly over to your team.

# Laning

Slark's laning isn't that strong. He's usually fine if he has support or has a 1v1 matchup against a melee hero. If contested, Slark will likely have difficulties.

Regardless of the laning configuration, Slark's laning can be split into two phases: before level 6 and after level 6. It's really important to get level 6 so that you're able to farm jungle camps.

Before hitting level 6, you'll usually need to play more carefully. Pounce has a relatively long cooldown, so if you're up against a dangerous lane you'll need to use it only for kill attempts or to escape.

After you hit level 6, you can play a lot more aggressively. As long as your opponent isn't able to kill you outright, you can and should bully solo opponents as much as possible. Use Pounce and Dark Pact to harass, then back off and regen back up. You can hide in the trees between last hits, allowing you to heal up without missing any farm.

Your goal is to get your opponent low enough that they're killable or have to leave the lane. It's often not necessary for your supports to stay and help you after you reach level 6; it's usually more effective for them to rotate and gank other lanes.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/lane-regen.jpg"
  caption="Healing up in lane." %}

If your opponents bring a lot of pressure to your lane, there's not much you can do. Just try to get level 6, then you can move into the jungle to farm. If it's safe, you can farm creeps under your tower. If not, and there's no help from your team to defend your tower, just let it go and focus on your farm.

## Items

Since Slark's laning phase isn't that strong, you'll want to bring plenty of regen. This allows you to stay in lane (and possibly play aggressively).

Recently, my preferred starting items have been tangos, salve, mango, clarity, and either a stout shield or a ring of protection. I get the stout shield if I'm anticipating a lot of harass, since it blocks damage and builds into a poor man's shield. Otherwise the ring of protection lets me build a faster ring of basilius (and you can always pick up a stout shield at the side shop if needed).

Slark can take advantage of a lot of small items during the laning phase.

* Ring of basilius gives you a bit of extra damage and mana regen, especially useful in an active lane.
* Orb of venom allows you to get in more harass.
* Magic stick gives you additional sustain in lane, especially against heroes that spam a lot of spells (like Bristleback).
* Poor Man's Shield helps you deal with harass-heavy lanes.
* Not to be overlooked, brown boots can give you a movespeed advantage to get in more harass.

## Harass

As with any lane, you want to get favorable harass in as much as possible. This isn't that easy since Slark's skills aren't the best suited for harassment. (Pounce has a long cooldown and Dark Pact damages yourself.) However, there are times where you are able to get in some harass, especially against a single melee hero.

The basic method of getting in harass is through right clicks. Since enemy melee heroes have to approach the creep wave to get last hits, you'll get a chance to hit them. Trading right clicks usually favors Slark, since he gets bonus damage through Essence Shift.

Since your opponent is likely to hit you back, getting a poor man's shield helps you come ahead when trading. You're also likely to draw creep aggro, so remember to [deaggro it]({% post_url 2014-02-19-creep-aggro %}) when you can.

You can also get in additional harass when you and your opponent are fighting over a last hit. Normally, you'll be looking at each other, trying to get the last hit or deny.

Instead, you can just right click them. They'll have to decide if they want to hit you back or wait to go for the last hit. If they wait you should be able to get in a few hits; otherwise you can continue fighting or back off as needed.

While you're hitting your opponent, you can also get your own last hits by using Dark Pact. This has the added benefit of getting in some extra harass damage. Just be careful not to bring yourself too low, especially if you aren't level 6.

## Techniques

Dark Pact allows you to get last hits that you otherwise would have missed. You can use it when there are multiple creeps that you need to last hit, or when you're not able to get some last hits under tower.

You can also use Dark Pact under your opponent's tower. Because your opponent likely feels safe, they'll come out to get last hits. Using Dark Pact allows you to get in some additional harass on your opponent without drawing tower aggro.

A neat trick against melee heroes is to leave a creep one hit away from death. This serves as bait; if your opponent goes in for that last hit (or deny), you'll be able to Pounce them and possibly get a kill. Naturally, this is more effective after you get some levels or if your opponent is low.

# Itemization

As we've seen, Slark has issues when it comes to team fighting---he's fairly squishy. Slark also suffers from mana problems and can have difficulty sticking on an opponent in fights.

This naturally suggests how we can build Slark to compensate for his weaknesses. Our primary focus will be to get a bunch of stats---they'll make him tankier and give him more mana to work with.

We'll also focus on items that allow Slark to start hitting and keep hitting his opponents. That is, we'll grab a mobility item as well as items that increase Slark's move speed or decrease his opponent's move speed.

As a final consideration, we'll look to get attack speed items on Slark. The faster Slark attacks, the more Essence Shift can steal.

Fortunately, as we'll see, there are a lot of items that will help Slark.

## Early Game

We already discussed starting items and very early game items. For our remaining early game items, we'll focus primarily on stats. This allows us to play as a surprisingly tanky Slark in team fights, even without a blink dagger or a shadow blade. You should probably get treads, aquila, and at least one of these other early game items every game.

Do note that the early game strength of these items can also be a weakness. These are cheap items that you can easily get and fill up your item slots. If your game is more passive and farm-oriented, you can skip some of them to bring out bigger items faster.

### Poor Man's Shield

A PMS is an excellent pickup in lanes where you expected to trade or get harassed. It makes right-click trades extremely favored towards Slark.

### Quelling Blade

As with many melee heroes, quelling blade is a good pickup for accelerating your farm. This is especially true if you anticipate doing a lot of jungling.

### Ring Of Aquila

Ring of aquila gives Slark some much needed mana regen, allowing him to be much more effective before needing to get more mana. It also gives Slark some reasonable stats.

### Power Treads

These are the best boots on Slark; they offer quite a bit. Set to strength, power treads give Slark a bit of extra HP to work with. Tread toggling to int allows Slark to get more out of his mana pool. Finally, the attack speed helps Slark steal stats and amplifies the amount of damage that Slark can deal.

### Magic Wand

Magic stick is already needed on Slark for extra mana or for when you get in trouble. Upgrading to a magic wand gives you a bit more extra stats to work with.

### Drums Of Endurance

Drums of endurance gives Slark a bit of everything he needs. Some stats for more HP and mana, move speed to keep up with his opponents, and a bit of attack speed. I've found drums to be extremely useful, and it has made the difference when I show up to earlier team fights.

## Shadow Blade vs Blink Dagger

At this point, you usually want to pick up a mobility item. Both shadow blade and blink dagger are really good items on Slark. They give you a means of initiation and make it much easier to land Pounce. Although you'll use these two items in similar ways, there are some differences that might affect which item you decide to buy.

### Shadow Blade

Shadow blade gives you a bit more offensive power, as it gives damage and attack speed. The extra invis damage is also useful, especially when you're solo ganking.

**Shadow blade makes it easier to find a gank target in areas where you don't have vision.** Since you can scout and then decide whether or not you want to commit to a fight, it can be safer to check your opponent's jungle with a shadow blade than with a blink dagger.

Shadow blade, however, relies on your opponent not having detection. This occurs in lower level pub games, but it also occurs when the opposing supports are poor and your team has a lot of map control. If your team has other heroes that can turn invisible, shadow blade becomes less effective since your opponent has more incentive to buy detection.

A small benefit to shadow blade is that it can be upgraded into a silver edge. This can be potentially useful to break passives. However, **do not immediately upgrade to a silver edge.** It costs a lot of gold for an effect that isn't of much use. You can use that gold to buy a more useful item. Buying a silver edge early will also make it harder for you to snowball, since it delays all of your item timings.

Although shadow blade does give you move speed, you're still limited in that you still have to walk in order to get closer or further from an opponent. You'll be able to tell if your opponent can see you (since you'll lose your Shadow Dance buff), but your opponent will also have a chance to react to you.

A final downside of shadow blade is that it costs mana to use. It's not much, but it does add to Slark's mana problems.

### Blink Dagger

Blink dagger doesn't give you the same offensive power as shadow blade, but makes up for it through increased mobility.

A big difference between blink dagger and shadow blade is that **it's much harder for your opponent to be able to spot you when you're using a blink dagger.** Since you can jump from out of vision, it's much harder for your opponent to react to you. This comes at a small cost---you need vision of your opponent in able to land a blink + Pounce combo.

This means that blink dagger is also more useful for escaping, if you get to use it. You can use blink to escape into trees or over terrain. Shadow blade doesn't let you do this if your opponent has detection.

An understated benefit of blink dagger is that **it's useful even when you aren't fighting.** Blink allows you to move around the map more quickly, in turn allowing you to farm faster. It also doesn't cost any mana to use.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/02/15/blink-farm.jpg"
  caption="A blink dagger allows you to farm more efficiently." %}

A notable downside of blink dagger is that **blink has anti-synergy with Dark Pact.** That is, the Dark Pact self damage causes your blink to break, forcing you to wait 3 seconds before you can blink. This is usually not a big deal, but might be a factor if you're trying to escape.

Recently, my personal preference is to get a blink dagger.

## Core Items

There are two additional items that are typically bought on Slark: sange and yasha as well as eye of skadi.

### Sange And Yasha

When I first started playing Slark, I didn't understand the value of this item. I also had trouble getting enough farm to buy it. The key to having good farm is to make sure you spend a lot of time farming. Participating in fights is good, but spending too much time looking for a gank (as opposed to showing up to a fight that is breaking out) is what really cuts into your farm.

Sange and yasha gives Slark damage, attack speed, move speed, and some more durability. The maim slow also helps to allow Slark to stick on an attack target. Again, all of this aligns with the types of items we want to build on Slark.

### Eye Of Skadi

This is probably the second most popular item for Slark to buy, after shadow blade. Skadi provides a lot of stats, as well as a slow.

You'll be quite tanky after completing a skadi. Usually, this will also mean that you can afford to be a bit more aggressive in fights---especially if you're very far ahead. If you're not that far ahead or your opponents have a lot of disable, you'll still need to be careful.

Depending on the game, you might prefer to delay picking up a skadi. In particular, a skull basher is a popular choice if you're ahead or need additional lockdown.

## Luxury Items

Unlike the previous items, Slark's luxury items are a lot more polarizing in that they don't provide all-around benefits. They're still very useful; you just need to decide what's the most important at the moment.

When picking which item you should buy, consider if your opponents have any potential threats that you still need to worry about. If so, try to go for an item that will help mitigate that threat (such as a butterfly against physical damage lineups). Other than that, you'll usually want to build attack speed and damage.

### Black King Bar

Against some teams, Dark Pact alone might not be enough. Against teams with a lot of disables or AoE nukes, you'll probably need a BKB to be comfortable in a team fight. **You might need to buy BKB after sange and yasha, before skadi.** Skadi provides little benefit if you're constantly disabled, so switching up the timing of these items allows you to once again have an impact in fights.

### Linken's Sphere

A very solid alternative to BKB. However, Linken's sphere is a much more situational pickup. It's especially useful against single-target ultimates that you can't Dark Pact off, namely Legion Commander's Duel, Doom's Doom, and Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse. Naturally, it's also less useful if your opponent has a lot of spammable single-target abilities.

### Moon Shard

Moon shard is actually a very strong item on Slark. It increases the amount of damage that Slark can get done during his Dark Pact + Pounce combo and increases the rate at which he'll steal stats. If you're not in need of a specific luxury item, moon shard is probably the way to go.

### Butterfly

A more balanced option than moon shard, butterfly is especially useful against teams that rely on physical damage. Being able to evade attacks can be very useful. Butterfly doesn't provide as much attack speed as moon shard, but it does provide some damage.

### Abyssal Blade

Formerly one of the go-to items on Slark, abyssal blade is actually not as valued anymore. The former reasoning was that you could get a skull basher / abyssal blade to help lock down opponents and kill them. With the introduction of moon shard, however, it's sometimes preferable to outright kill your targets.

That's not to say that abyssal blade is a bad item. If your team needs lockdown, especially against BKB opponents, abyssal is still a good choice. There's also a side bonus of giving Slark a bit more HP to work with.

### Monkey King Bar

MKB isn't a terrible item on Slark, but it's not an item that Slark wants to buy. It's simply not as useful as his other options, unless you need to deal with someone who has evasion.

As an aside, **don't rush MKB against PA.** I see this on occasion; it's not good for two reasons.

First, you're sacrificing the benefits of all the core items that you should have bought (namely stats). MKB does not address any of Slark's innate problems.

Second, you don't need to rely on right clicks to kill PA early on. You can just nuke her down with magical damage---your combo should easily take out half of her HP pool. MKB's usefulness is later on in the game, where you need to rely more on physical damage to get kills.

### Refresher Orb

The only signficant direct benefit of a refresher orb is the mana regen. However, the active is really good for a farmed Slark. Namely, refresher orb gives you access to double BKB, double abyssal blade, and double Shadow Dance. Being able to use all of your big actives twice should be a significant edge in team fights.

# Miscellaneous

## Landing Pounce

As with other skillshots, it takes a bit of practice to get used to landing pounce. There are essentially three ways to land Pounce---with teammate set up, with blink or shadow blade, or completely unassisted.

First, teammate set up is pretty straightforward. Similar to chain stunning, someone else disables your target first. This gives you time to approach them and Pounce them.

Second, landing Pounce with a blink or shadow blade relies on the following principle: **if you can right click someone, you can Pounce them.**

With shadow blade, you can right click someone (applying the shadow blade damage) and then immediately pounce.

With a blink dagger, you blink right next to your opponent and Pounce. Make sure your target is in the same direction that you're Pouncing in.

Third, you migth need to land Pounce without any setup. The closer you can get to your opponent, the easier they are to Pounce. Again, if you can right click them, you can Pounce them.

It's easier to get close to your opponent if you approach from alternate angles. Backstabbing, coming in through the side, or coming in through a tree line all help you get close enough for a more guaranteed Pounce.

You can, of course, also land Pounce from further away. This is easier when your opponent is moving directly towards or away from you, since it lines up with your Pounce movement. Attempting to Pounce at a perpendicular angle to your opponent's movement is possible, but it's hardest to land Pounce this way.

## Shadow Dance Buff

An extremely useful part about Shadow Dance is that you get a buff when it's active. We've already mentioned that this has a use for finding wards, but there's another really good use---knowing when you're walking into a risky area.

When walking up a ramp or to any area where you have vision, pay attention to your buff. This is especially true when you are looking for a team fight. **If the buff disappears, Dark Pact immediately.** Your opponent will probably jump you because they think they'll be able to disable you before you can react, causing them to waste disables and give your team a decent counter-initiation opportunity.

## Overextending

It's very easy to snowball and be lulled into a false sense of security. You end up thinking that you're invincible in fights, leading to a bad initiation that ends up losing the game.

Remember that, as the game goes later, initiation as Slark gets increasingly risky. Your opponents will finally catch on to how to deal with you---buying detection, baiting heroes, being grouped as five, etc. Your opponents will also be more committed and ready to defending their base structures, as opposed to the less structured fights that they previously lost.
