  Breaking down the laning phase decision-making in a 4.6K offlane Enchantress game.
---

Welcome to the first post in this replay review series! In these posts I'll be looking at and analyzing a small segment of a single replay.

In this first review, I'll be going through my thoughts during the laning phase as I play an offlane Enchantress. My MMR was around 4600 for this game, although I believe the average was slightly higher. The overall game ended up being a stomp, but there's still a lot to be learned from the laning phase.

Let's get started!

# Planning

## Draft

During the draft and the pre-game, it's important to figure out some idea of how you want your laning phase to unfold. Here are the results of the draft:

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/ench-draft.jpg"
  caption="The final draft." %}

By the end of the draft, my team already has an understanding of where each hero on our team is laning, as well as where each hero on the opposing team will be laning. We actually use this information during the draft to help pick stronger lanes, but that's a bit outside the scope of this post. Let's go through both team's lineups to figure out what the lanes will look like.

First, my team (Radiant). Our carry is clearly Spectre, and the only obvious support on our team is Oracle; they'll be going to the safe lane (bottom).

The three remaining heroes are Invoker, Legion Commander, and Enchantress. Invoker and Legion Commander are both heroes that are played as cores, while Enchantress can be a core or a (jungling) support. Invoker and Legion Commander can both be played in the mid lane and the offlane, although Invoker is more suited towards (and commonly played) mid and Legion Commander is more suited towards the offlane.

So, Invoker's our mid. As you already know, I played Enchantress offlane. This leaves Legion Commander as a jungler. If we wanted to, we could have put Enchantress jungle and Legion Commander offlane instead.

Next, the Dire team. The roles on their team are very straightforward: Outworld Devourer, Slark, and Tidehunter are cores whereas Crystal Maiden and Omniknight are supports.

These three cores have a bit of flexibility in where they lane, but the preferred laning configuration is fairly clear. Slark and Tidehunter can both go in either side lane, but Slark is better suited for the safe lane while Tidehunter is better suited for the offlane. OD is suited for mid or the safe lane; since Dire needs a mid it's clear that's where he's going.

As for the supports, they can either defensive trilane or dual lane their safe lane while CM jungles. Supporting Tidehunter isn't very necessary. Dire ended up going with the first option.

## Lane Dynamics

The reason figuring out the lanes is important is that it lets you plan ahead as to what you'll face in lane. Based on the above, I'll be playing solo offlane Enchantress and I'm expecting to go up against Slark, Omniknight, and possibly Crystal Maiden. It turns out that this will probably be a decent lane for me. Let's look at why.

First, I want to consider how they might kill me. Although Enchantress doesn't have much HP, she's very fast. It's also hard to deal damage to her through right clicks, due to Untouchable. On top of this, Nature's Attendants gives me some additional sustain.

Other than right clicks (which won't be very effective), the only other damage Dire will have is Slark's Dark Pact and Pounce, Crystal Maiden's Frostbite and Crystal Nova, and Omniknight's Purification. In terms of lockdown, there's CM's Frostbite, Slark's Pounce, and Omniknight's Degen Aura.

This is a bunch of stuff, but I'm not too worried. I will be in trouble if they get to use all of it on me, but without all three heroes it's fairly unlikely that they can kill me. This is mostly dependent on our relative levels---as long as Dire doesn't get a really good start (by completely zoning me or if I feed kills) I'll stay ahead on levels.

It also depends on me playing my lane correctly. Although I can't be overeager and start fights all the time, I can trade harass effectively and easily---Slark and Omniknight are melee heroes and Crystal Maiden's right clicks don't do much. I want to apply enough pressure that the supports have to stay and deal with me, but watch my spacing so I don't feed.

## Items

Now that we understand the basics of the lane, it's time to buy starting items. I don't need much regen since I don't anticipate taking much harass; I'll just need one or two regen items. I don't *need* anything else, so I opt for brown boots. Enchantress is already fast; the additional speed makes it harder for me to get killed and gives me a window where I can easily chase my opponents down.

I ended up buying brown boots and one set of tangos, leaving me with 100 gold. I spent that gold on two iron branches, giving me some more stats. My support also pooled me an observer ward, which is pretty standard.

# Laning Phase

Now that we've gotten all the planning out of the way, let's get to the good stuff. I showed up a bit late to my lane because I fed first blood at the rune. This didn't actually impact my lane, other than being forced to take Nature's Attendants at level 1 (meaning I don't have Untouchable).

## Pre-Game

Before I fed first blood, I went out to get my ward down.

{% include image.html

  caption="Blocking the pull camp." %}

As an offlaner, you want to go plant your ward as soon as possible. (If you're a support, you want to pool your offlaner that ward quickly so they can head out.) From the minimap you can see that, other than me, both teams have barely left their base. This ensures that the enemy team won't know that I already had the chance to place my ward.

## Losing The Lane

As it turns out, within the first 5 seconds of our creep waves meeting, Slark made a pretty significant mistake. I'm pretty sure it led Dire to lose their safe lane way harder than they should have. Here's what the creep wave looked like:

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/slark-aggro.jpg"
  caption="Destroying creep equilibrium." %}

Although Slark had a pretty good creep block, seeing the creep wave like this is really good for me. The reason is that I know that the creep equilibrium will push towards my tower.

The first mistake that Slark made was that he right clicked one of my creeps. This slightly pushes the equilibrium towards me, but isn't too bad of a mistake (and it's a mistake you can fix by denying your creeps a lot).

The second, and bigger, mistake that Slark made was keeping [creep aggro]({% post_url 2014-02-19-creep-aggro %}) on him. This causes Dire's creeps to take less damage (since Slark is taking some of it), so they'll survive longer and push the lane. If you take another look at the screenshot, you'll see that my creep is almost dead whereas Dire's creep is still at more than half health. This is a pretty clearly signal that the creeps will push towards me.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/dire-creeps-push-1.jpg"
  caption="The result." %}

Here's the result of this seemingly small detail---Dire's first creep wave is now fighting my second creep wave and the waves are way closer to my tower. This guarantees that I'll at least be able to safely get experience for this first wave.

The reason this mistake is so big is that it actually compounds. This is what things look like a few seconds later:

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/dire-creeps-push-2.jpg"
  caption="Double ranged creeps." %}

Dire's second creep wave has now arrived, giving them two ranged creeps and more creeps overall. Consequently, I get to soak up experience under the safety of my tower.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/tower-farming.jpg"
  caption="Farming under the safety of my tower." %}

I also get to continue farming in a much safe position until Dire can do something to change the lane equilibrium. However, their easy camp is blocked. I'm also able to contest the hard camp pull a bit if they decide to go for it. For the most part I just get to farm the lane in a pretty safe spot.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/safe-farming.jpg"
  caption="Creep equilibrium in a much safer spot." %}

The end result of Slark's mistake is that I get level 3 and a bit of CS by two minutes. That's pretty good for an offlaner, especially against a trilane.

## Harass

Let's backtrack a bit and take a look at the harassment that's been going on. Their supports (in particular CM) have been trying to harass and zone me, ever since the laning phase started (as a support generally should be).

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/harass.jpg"
  caption="Getting harassed and zoned." %}

As we discussed earlier, I have to be aware of how many heroes I'm dealing with at any given moment in time. Although there are three heroes in the lane, they aren't all in range to be a threat. I'm in good shape against any one hero. Against two heroes, there's still room for me to play aggressive but I have to read the situation. If all three heroes get within range of me there's a reasonable chance that I'll die at low levels.

In the above screenshot I'm only level 1 and don't have Untouchable. There are also two heroes approaching me, so I need to respect them and back off. I already know that the creeps are pushing towards me, so I don't mind backing off either---I know I'm going to get a chance to get my experience.

In the earlier screenshots, you can actually see that Omniknight dropped a lane ward as they zoned me out. This is generally a good ward to have, as it allows you to keep tabs on the offlaner. As a support, this lets you decide when you can go do your own thing (stacking, pulling) and when you need to be doing more babysitting (harassing, being nearby).

Once the creeps ended up under my tower, the supports could no longer harass me. This also gave me level 3, so if they did come to harass I could easily trade right clicks and harass them back. Unfortunately, I can't show any examples of this since it didn't really happen this game.

## Lane Changes

### Support Rotations

A little while later, I ended up in this scenario:

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/support-rotation.jpg"
  caption="Notice anything strange?" %}

Although I had seen the supports a short time ago, what I see here is fairly suspicious, so I call out that the supports are missing from top. There are a few reasons I'm clued in to the fact that something's wrong:

- I don't see the supports on the minimap.
- Not seeing the supports is extra suspicious because they've generally been trying to harass me or pull whenever they got the chance.
- The supports haven't been able to do much to me ever since the creeps got under my tower. They're probably feeling somewhat useless and want to get something done elsewhere on the map.
- If you were paying attention extra closely, you would have noticed that Crystal Maiden had a smoke of deceit in the previous screenshot!

As it turns out, my hunch was correct (note the minimap):

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/supports-ganking.jpg"
  caption="Dire supports ganking mid." %}

When Slark goes on me, this also confirms my suspicions. If the supports hadn't rotated, they would probably be here to turn this into a kill attempt.

### New Lane Dynamics

Now that I've identified that Slark is alone, there are a number of things that change about the lane dynamic:

- I can freely trade harass with Slark. At level 3, I have 2 points Untouchable and 1 point Nature's Attendants. Slark, on the other hand, is also level 3 which means he'll probably have a 1-1-1 build. He barely has any nuke damage and definitely loses out in right-click battles.
- I can play aggressively and bully the Slark. Again, I win trades, and there's no one to punish me. I won't even take very much damage from creeps since they are also affected by Untouchable.
- Creep equilibrium is not as important since I won't be punished for being too far out. I can dive past creep waves, ruin equilibrium, etc. if it means I get to bully the Slark more.
- All of this changes when Slark hits level 6. Although Enchantress can still bully Slark, she can't force him out of the lane since he can just hide and regen up. Additionally, Slark can just leave to farm the jungle.

So, while the supports are gone, my approach is now to **right click Slark as much as possible.**

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/ench-harass-1.jpg"
  caption="Harassing Slark when possible." %}

In a melee vs ranged matchup, the melee hero generally wants to stay out of harass range. As Slark, you would only come up at the right time to get a last hit, then you would back off again. You could also use [creep aggro]({% post_url 2014-02-19-creep-aggro %}) to reposition the wave a bit more favorably. However, Enchantress doesn't care about this in a 1v1 matchup---she'll just chase you and hit you.

As it turns out, Slark spent way too much extra time within my right click range.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/ench-harass-2.jpg"
  caption="Slark's now low from harass." %}

I'm more than happy to chase Slark a bit to get in some extra harass damage. I can also go for kill attempts if I see one. This is unlikely to happen, however, since Slark can Pounce away.

## Kill Opportunities

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/bad-gank.jpg"
  caption="Dire being overconfident." %}

As it happens, Omniknight returned to the lane. This apparently triggered Slark to go on me, despite being very low. This would be fine later on, when Slark and Omniknight have some levels. As it stands, this is basically suicide from Slark.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/slark-dead.jpg"
  caption="A last hit away from death." %}

Although I'm more than happy to get a freebie, it's still important to pay attention to continue reading the situation. In the above screenshot, note that Omniknight is right clicking me in the midst of a full Radiant creep wave---this is going to be a lot of damage. Moreover, I know that he's low level, just used both of his spells, and probably low on mana.

Combining all of these points leads to the conclusion that I will also have a chance to kill Omniknight. This is what things look like a few seconds later:

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/omniknight-low.jpg"
  caption="Going for a second kill." %}

Crystal Maiden TP'd in, allowing her to Frostbite me and save Omniknight. Had she not come, however, Omniknight probably would have died.

## Dominating A Lane

As a result of everything that's happened so far, I'm in great shape. I've also hit level 6, giving me access to Impetus---this allows me to harass harder and have more chances to go for kills. On top of this, Slark is still level 5 and doesn't have the sustain from Shadow Dance. I want to make the lane as rough as possible for him as I'm way stronger than him.

It's really important I take advantage of this opportunity, and it's not just because it's useful to keep the enemy carry down. The two supports have largely been roaming over the past few minutes. This is essentially saying that they are sacrificing Slark's lane in the hopes of getting more done elsewhere on the map.

If I can bully the Slark a lot, the supports have to do a lot of work to make up for it. If they're unable to get anything done (as was the case in this game), it ends up being a lose-lose situation for them.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/imp-harass.jpg"
  caption="Harassing with Impetus." %}

Now that I have Impetus, I can use it to deal a lot of extra damage when I harass Slark. He really can't go for last hits unless he's under his tower; he should just be aiming to soak up exp from the fog so that he can then recover in the jungle. Showing in lane gets him really low.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/force-pounce.jpg"
  caption="Forcing Slark to Pounce away." %}

Slark ends up using Pounce to get away from me. I don't know whether or not I can catch up to him, but I figure that it doesn't hurt to see. If he's not fast enough or if he's lingering around, I have a reasonable chance of getting a kill.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/kill-fishing.jpg"
  caption="Looking around for Slark." %}

I did indeed find him. He tries to juke me by running right.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/juking.jpg"
  caption="Juking around the trees." %}

Slark then ran around the patch of trees. As he rounded the corner I lost sight of him, so I had to decide how I thought he would try to escape:

- Run directly through the trees and towards his tower.
- Hide in the trees, pause, then run out the way he came in (on the right side).
- Hide in the trees and try to juke around when I follow him in.
- Try to get to the side shop and TP.

These are roughly in the order that I thought was most likely. Since I had tangos, I actually tried to eat a tree so I could go in directly and cut him off; this would have been the fastest and most likely way to deal with all four options. Unfortunately, I misclicked, and moved my hero away from the trees; it would have taken too long to go back and try again.

I end up guessing that he'll take the first option. His hope is that I'll follow him through the trees but be fogged enough that I don't get a chance to hit him. Since I believe he's going to take the direct path towards his tower, I just turn around to try to cut him off.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/cutting-off-escapes.jpg"
  caption="Anticipating where Slark will run." %}

My guess is spot-on (although I end up phasing through Slark). This allows me to pick up my second solo kill in lane.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/slark-dead-2.jpg"
  caption="My reward for playing aggressively." %}

## Fight Or Flight

When Slark respawned, he went in for another kill attempt.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/slark-gank.jpg"
  caption="Slark playing aggressively." %}

I wasn't sure if I could man up and fight this---I'm out of mana. This means no Nature's Attendants and very few Impetus shots. Additionally, Slark's already on top of me so Impetus won't be as useful. Omniknight also adds some additional burst damage.

So, I decide I don't want to fight this. Even if Slark lands his Pounce, I could probably run away afterwards and get out fine.

However, I ended up going with a different option. Since I'm already low on mana, I want to return to the fountain and regen (or ferry out a clarity).

I decide to TP, but there's a problem: not enough mana. I see that I have a one charge magic wand, allowing me to have a total of 45 + 15 = 60 mana. I need a second charge on my wand in order to TP. So, my decision is to wait until Slark uses another spell (giving me a second charge), pop my wand, and TP.

Worked like a charm:

  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/tp-out.jpg"
  caption="TPing out when there's potential danger." %}

## Creep Cutting

The past few events have caused my creep wave to push. By the time I get back to lane, it's under Dire's tower. Controlling equilibrium isn't as important for me anymore, since I've already picked up some levels. Still, I don't want to give Slark a break if I can avoid it.

Since the supports still aren't both back, I can continue to play aggressive. Manually casting Impetus allows me to harass Slark under tower without drawing aggro. Even if I do draw aggro, I can always deaggro the tower.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/driving-slark-back.jpg"
  caption="Creep cutting." %}

I ended up driving Slark away (note where he is on the minimap). Since I'm now behind the tower, I decide that I might as well creep cut:

- This keeps me in a good position to play aggressively on Slark.
- This allows my creeps to get in more damage on the tier 1 tower.
- Enchantress can easily creep cut with Untouchable.

I actually also dragged the wave down to the easy camp. This way, I don't have to worry about the (already little) creep damage and I can pick up a little bit more farm.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/positioning-mistake.jpg"
  caption="Slark tries to return to his tower." %}

Slark actually interpreted my creep cutting as a chance to return to his tower for some farm. There's still no reason I can't bully him. Either he'll stay to fight and die or he'll escape and I get a free tower.

{% include image.html
  src="http://cdn.dota2notes.com/images/screenshots/2016/03/10/slark-escape.jpg"
  caption="Nearly killing Slark." %}

Unfortunately, he got away from me. I could go into the trees for this kill, but I figure that it's too hard to get. I'm too far away to get vision, and Slark can just Pounce into some other part of the trees.

Fortunately, my Spectre decided to go in for the kill. I think Slark could have still escaped, but he messed up and accidentally latched his Pounce onto Spectre.

# Replay Recap

As we can see, there's a lot going on during a Dota 2 game, even just during the laning phase. To recap, here are some of the major points we looked at:

- Anticipate and understand your lane.
- Adjust your play as your lane dynamics change.
- Control the creep equilibrium!
- Take advantage of your opponent's mistakes and punish them.

Thanks for reading!
